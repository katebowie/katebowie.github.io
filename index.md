excerpt: "About Me..."

Hello hi! I’m Kate Bowie, a midwesterner studying the human microbiome, or the collection of bacteria that live in and on the human body, and I work in Lisa Karstens' lab. I grew up in [Indiana](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_USA_IN.svg#/media/File:Map_of_USA_IN.svg) and moved to Portland, Oregon to work on a biomedical engineering PhD at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU). Sure, I spend a lot of time in the laboratory thinking about all the microbes inhabiting the human body and their impact on disease… but I do my *best* to stay balanced with other hobbies. When I’m not in the lab and our world isn’t enduring a pandemic, I love seeing live music, playing soccer, and backpacking. In a post-covid19 world, I spend most of my free time trying to educate myself on systemic racism, playing my synthesizer, and even more backpacking.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Quantitative microbiome profiling
- bacterial translocation in the context of prostate cancer
- [Frictionless Reproducible Data Fellows Program](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io)
