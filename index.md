Hello hi! I’m Kate Bowie, a postdoc studying the microbiome of the built environment at Yale University. I work across the [Peccia lab](https://peccialab.yale.edu) and [Gerstein lab](https://www.gersteinlab.org), where I apply computational tools to tackle environmental engineering questions. My research spans the high biomass world of wastewater, all the way to the sparse and notoriously challenging indoor air microbiome. I'm fascinated by how these microbes evolve in these spaces and how these changes impact human health. 


I recieved my PhD from Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon. I was part of the [Karstens' lab](https://karstenslab.github.io), where I mainly focused on the urinary microbiome. I grew up in [Indiana](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_USA_IN.svg#/media/File:Map_of_USA_IN.svg). I'm curious, hardworking, and passionate about trying to understand the microbes we share space with. 


Outside of my postdoc, I spend most of my time both playing and watching ice hockey, as well as following the English Premier League and college football. I love all teams blue: the Seattle Kraken, Chelsea F.C., and the University of Notre Dame. I'm currently working on a small project analyzing skating based off of data from the [2025 Big Data Cup](https://github.com/bigdatacup/Big-Data-Cup-2025?tab=readme-ov-file), and will link here when ready.
